# React ES6/ES2015 Boilerplate


This is a truly barebones React app written in ES6 using Webpack and Babel.

I used the smart/dumb component distinction mentioned  [here](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0) and [here](https://medium.com/@learnreact/container-components-c0e67432e005#.h4utk9tzw) - smart components are found in the containers directory. I also tossed in an ApiKeys file that's gitignored, so that safety comes built-in. Feel free to clone it and use it!

To run it:
```
$ npm i && npm start
```
